# RxFlow
RxFlow is a B2B SaaS web application for independent pharmacies that streamlines operations from prescription intake to pickup. It replaces manual tasks with a unified workflow system, managing patient records, dispensing queues, and inventory (including lot/expiry tracking), while integrating with openFDA and FHIR data feeds.
